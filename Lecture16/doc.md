Execution Stack and Execution Context are fundamental concepts in JavaScript that are closely related and play crucial roles in understanding how code execution works within the language.

1. **Execution Stack**:
   - Also known as "call stack" or "control stack", it is a data structure used to manage the execution of function calls in JavaScript.
   - When a script starts executing, a global execution context is created, and its corresponding function (often referred to as the "main" or "global" function) is pushed onto the execution stack.
   - Whenever a function is invoked, a new execution context for that function is created and pushed onto the top of the execution stack. This process is called "stacking" or "pushing onto the stack."
   - Each time a function completes its execution, its execution context is popped off the stack, and control returns to the context below it. This is known as "popping off the stack."
   - The execution stack follows a Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure, meaning the last function added to the stack is the first to be executed and removed.

2. **Execution Context**:
   - Execution context can be thought of as the environment in which JavaScript code is executed. It comprises various components that determine how the code behaves and what data it can access during execution.
   - There are three types of execution contexts in JavaScript:
     a. **Global Execution Context**: This is the default or outermost execution context that represents the environment in which the global JavaScript code is executed. It includes global variables, functions, and `this`.
     b. **Function Execution Context**: Each time a function is invoked, a new execution context specific to that function is created. It includes local variables, function arguments, and a reference to the outer lexical environment (closure).
     c. **Eval Execution Context**: Created when code is executed within the `eval()` function. It has its own variable environment.
   - Execution context consists of three important components:
     a. **Variable Object (VO)**: This is where the variables, function declarations, and arguments for a particular context are stored.
     b. **Scope Chain**: It determines the accessibility of variables. It is formed by the lexical environment and the outer environments (lexical scope).
     c. **This Value**: It refers to the value of the `this` keyword within the context.

In summary, the execution stack manages the order of function calls, while the execution context defines the environment in which the code is executed, including variables, scope, and `this` binding. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing efficient and error-free JavaScript code.
